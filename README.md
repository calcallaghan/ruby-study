# Ruby Study and Tutorials

## What are you up to?

Well, I'm the Product Manager for the DevTools team, and I want to learn more about how our customers will use the product we'll be building. For me, that means immersing myself in DevOps practices, and building an engineer's-eye view of as many of the TTS toolsets as I can. I'm a much better Product Manager when I can get my hands dirty and experience people's workflows firsthand. 

I've built a lot of tools for everyday consumer-level usage, and I've always enjoyed working at the platform level. With DevTools, it's like I've been given the keys to the meta-platform. It's exciting and intimidating, and it's my favorite job ever.

## What is this repo for?

This is a personal repository for testing, tracking, and learning Ruby, with the overall aim of building fluency with the Rails Template.
