# Ruby Study and Tutorials

## What are you up to?

Well, I'm the Product Manager for the DevTools team, and I want to learn more about how our customers use the product we'll be building. For me, that means immersing myself in DevOps practices, and building an engineer's-eye view of as many of the TTS toolsets as I can. I'm a much better Product Manager when I can get my hands dirty and experience people's workflows firsthand.  

## What is this repo for?

This is a personal repository for testing, tracking, and learning.
